        <p><i>"The Algorithm"</i> was built by <a href="https://decifer.tech/" target="_blank" class="about-links">Decifer Studio</a>, founded by Alia ElKattan and Lujain Ibrahim, through the generous support of <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/creative-media-awards/" target="_blank" class="about-links">The Mozilla Foundation's Creative Media Award</a>. </p>
        
        <p>
            While research on how recommender systems function is prevalent in computer science and related fields, the public's understanding of “The Algorithm” is extremely limited. This project aims to change that. </p>
        <p>
            "The Algorithm" is a part of our studio's greater mission of dymistifying emerging technologies like algorithms and articial intelligence, explaining both how they work and do not work, to the general public. We believe an informed public can more meaningfully participate in the development and regulation of these technologies, and that we can collectively shape our technological futures.

        <p>
            We live in the age of algorithmically-curated short-form video. TikTok is the fastest growing social media app today, whose appeal has led to the rise of Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and more similar feeds. The recommendation algorithm that powers it is at the center of discourse on TikTok’s successes, failures, and harms. Users of TikTok, who are primarily young people, describe “The Algorithm” as this greater-than-life force that provides eerily accurate recommendations. With this attention has come great media coverage and research on the impact and potential harms of recommender systems (e.g. recent reports that they push content on eating disorders and self-harm onto young users’ feeds). </p>
