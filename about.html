<h2>  WHY "THE ALGORITHM"?</h2>

<p>
    "The Algorithm" aims to demystify recommender systems for the broader public. It is a part of our larger mission to leverage creative coding and web-based experiences to build public literacy of emerging technologies. To delve deeper into the topic, please check out our <a class="about-links" target = "_blank" href="resources.html">resources</a> section, or <a href="contact.html" target = "_blank" class="about-links"> contact us</a>.<br><br>

<h2> THE BUILDING PROCESS </h2>

<p>The Algorithm was built following a research period, during which we synthesized the relevant literature from across computer science, law, policy, and the social sciences, and attended conferences such as the <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/events/optimizing-for-what-algorithmic-amplification-and-society" target="_blank" class="about-links">Algorithmic Amplification Symposium.</a> </p>

<p>We then wanted to build a first-person experience that uses the format people engage with these algorithms in (i.e., a video-based social media feed) as the medium. To create a feed that would be usable by people of different demographics, we used <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank" class="about-links">p5.js</a> animations of different aesthetics (e.g., emoji, 3D, text-based), colors, speeds, and shapes. </p>

<p>Using code-based animations allowed us to both change the meta features to create personalized content as well as multiply our animation pieces into a larger number of content pieces. Throughout the experience, our "algorithm" keeps track of what style, shape, color, and speed the user interacts with, and adjusts its recommendations accordingly.</p>

<p> Our code repository is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/whatsthealgorithm/whatsthealgorithm" target="_blank" class="about-links">GitHub</a>, and we encourage people to use it as they wish.<br><br>

<h2>  WHAT'S NEXT? </h2>

<p>Our hope is for "The Algorithm" to be a first step to getting more people acquainted with recommender systems, leading to both further engagement and similar projects destructing other technologies. We built "The Algorithm" with an explicitly educational purpose in mind, and are looking forward to building lesson plans, workshop templates, and other educational material around it.</p>

        <!-- <p><b>Why social media algorithms?</b></p>
        <p>
            We live in the age of algorithmically-curated short-form video. TikTok is the fastest growing social media app today, whose appeal has led to the rise of Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and more similar feeds. The recommendation algorithm that powers it is at the center of discourse on TikTok’s successes, failures, and harms. Users of TikTok, who are primarily young people, describe “The Algorithm” as this greater-than-life force that provides eerily accurate recommendations. With this attention has come great media coverage and research on the impact and potential harms of recommender systems (e.g. recent reports that they push content on eating disorders and self-harm onto young users’ feeds). </p>
